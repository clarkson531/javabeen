<h2>Our Story</h2>
	<p> Since 2019, the Doe family managed to keep a nine to five job in an office. That was until the Covid pandemic hit. Though it was a difficult, the Jane and John Doe found a silverlining in their layover in the office. Jane and John would carpool everyday to their job and often made it a point to get coffee on their way to work. They often dreamed about having their own coffee shop and being able to work from the shop casually. Thats when Java Been was born! In July of 2020 Jane and John took the risk and opened their very own business. Aiming to give families, entrepreneurs,and aspiring business makers a safe calming place to work, connect, and find motivation.  </p>
